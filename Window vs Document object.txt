Window vs Document object

Introduction
	Window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the most of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more. On the other hand, document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.

Window object
	It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser. It is the object of the browser. Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object. We can access the window from the window only. i.e., window.window. Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
	Syntax
			window.propertyname;

Document object
	It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser. It is loaded inside the window. It is the object of window property. All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document. We can access the document from a window using the window.document. Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc... can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title.
	Syntax
